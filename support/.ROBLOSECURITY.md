# Getting the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie for Account Authentication

## About .ROBLOSECURITY

The .ROBLOSECURITY cookie (which in pyrblx may be passed through 'robloxtoken') allows for full API use, which includes the bigger majority of POST and DELETE requests and most of GET, PATCH and PUT requests. The cookie acts as a token for logging into a Roblox account. Although the cookie is not required to use pyrblx, most of pyrblx's functionality requires it.
